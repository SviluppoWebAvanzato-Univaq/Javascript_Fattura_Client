# Javascript_Fattura_Client
> Example client for the RESTful API "Fattura" (Invoice) developed with Javascript

 This is a simple client for the "Fattura" (invoice) RESTful API developed during the course lectures. 
It shows how to call the service using the XMLHTTPRequest object, the Fetch API,
and the JQuery ajax helper.
 
## Usage

This is a *sample application* developed during the lectures of the  
[**Sviluppo Web Avanzato course**](https://sviluppowebavanzato-univaq.github.io). 
The code is organized to best match the lecture topics and examples. 
It is not intended for production use and is not optimized in any way. 

*This example code will be shown and described approximately during the 12th lecture of the course, 
so wait to download it, since it may get updated in the meanwhile.*

## Installation

Just open the index.html file.
